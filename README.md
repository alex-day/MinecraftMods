# Minecraft Mods

This is the source code for some spin-off/expansion mods that were based on [The Node Pack](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272485-1-0-0-the-node-pack)

I had totally forgotten that I even made these, and I don't remember ever getting around to sharing them. But this was sitting around on my iMac's hard drive so I thought I'd upload it. :)

This was found in a folder titled "Minecraft Modding 1.5.1", so I'm asusming it's for that version of Minecraft.

Huge credit goes out to my dad, Grant, who played these mods more than anyone else I know.

I'm not actively maintaining these, you're welcome to use as inspiration! :)
